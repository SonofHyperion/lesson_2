      When I was travelling through the streets of Hong Kong, I found that there are many relics from early 20th century. There are many mature city walk routines in Hong Kong, and you can easily find a routine in the websites or other resource. 
      <br /> 
      <br /> 
      This reminds me of the city that I have been in for 4 years, Shanghai.Shanghai was the most international and fashion city in China since late 19th century, churches and villas built by the British and the French along with the ancient Chinese building have become valuable cultural heritage today.
      <br /> 
      <br /> 
      Shanghai has raised a campaign called "readable city" since 2017. Protected areas with historical features have been set up, and many citizens began to realize the value of historical blocks thanks to this campaign. However, because of the pandemic, the heat of activity drops. Also, there is no unified city walk routine or introduction platform for historic buildings between different districts.
      <br /> 
      <br /> 
      Therefore, I want to build a website to integrate the information of various quaint buildings in Shanghai and provide people with travel suggestions about city walk, guiding them to discover the rich culture behind Shanghai. I hope to make money by providing online and offline guided Tours. However, this is not only for monetization, but also for the preservation of Shanghai's history, because with the progress of the city's old-building renovation, more and more living relics are being demolished. We hope that this website can become a witness of Shanghai's memory.
