      The Chinese University of Hong Kong is located in Sha Tin and I live in Sha Tin. At the same time, I am also a Chinese food lover. So I'd like to know what Chinese restaurants are in Sha Tin and which might be good for future tasting. 
      <br />
      So I compiled my own index to measure the quality of each Chinese restaurant in Sha Tin. This measure measures the impact of reviews, positive reviews, negative reviews and price. According to this index, I found that Sha Tin 18 Restaurant is probably the best restaurant in Sha Tin.
      The graph was shown on the left. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
      The second picture shows the positive reviews. The picture shows that Sha Tin 18 is the most highly rated Chinese restaurant in Sha Tin, followed by Xinghaihui.

      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      The third graph shows the most reviewed restaurants. The most reviews can mean that the restaurant is popular and people eat there, but it can also mean that the restaurant is controversial. Overall, Lung Wah Hotel is the most reviewed Sha Tin Chinese restaurant.

      <br />
      The fourth picture shows a restaurant with fish as one of its signature dishes. I wanted to eat something with fish, and found that there are five Chinese restaurants in Sha Tin that are good at fish.
